SQL Database

For our database, we decided to use Microsoft's SQL Server which allows us to install a SQL server onto a computer. We choose this over Oracle because it is free and was easy to install. Starting with installing the server, we first went to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads. From there, there are two choices; the developer version or the express version. For our project, the express version is more than sufficient for our needs. After that, it was installed on a computer that will constantly remain on so that the database can be accessed not only by us but also by users requesting information. We did a basic install of the express server and left the name as the default which is SQLEXPRESS. From there it asked us if we wished to install some languages such as Python and R which we allowed it to do. Once that was done, the server was installed and several programs were also installed to help manage it like the SQL Server Configuration Manager and some debugging tools.

We then went into the management console to to make it available remotely. We did this by going to the SQL Server Network Configuration tab and expanding it so that we saw Protocols for SQLEXPRESS. That then gave us three options to adjust which are Shared Memory, Named Pipes and TCP/IP. By default, TCP/IP is disabled which means the first change to the server was to enable that which then required us to restart the server. Once that was done, we then went and installed the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio which functions just like how MySQL does only it gives us more access to edit and view things from the database. With it installed on the same computer as the server, we then connected to the server using Windows Authentication. Once connected, we then went down to the managment section and then the SQL Server Logs. We then selected the current log and then filtered out the log to find the port number that the server was currently listening on. Once we have the port number, we can then connect to the server remotely from other computers. We then also created logins by  By installing Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio on the other computers, it will enable us to login to the server under different usernames. This was accomplished by going to the security tab and right clicking it. We then go to new and select login. This then brings up the login page where we specify a Windows user or a SQL user. For this project, we are using a SQL user which means we need to provide a usernanme and password. We then have additional options to either have the password be temporary and require the user to change on their next login or to make it a permanent password. For this, everyone starts with a temporary password which they then must change. Once the logins are complete, we can then have users sign in remotely with their username and password and telling it where the server is. This is where the port number is used, we tell SSMS that we want to sign in to a database engine with the name being the IP Address of the server followed by the port number. An example of this is 123.156.0.78,115. We then select SQL Server Authentication so that we can sign in and then put in our username and password.This then gives us access to the server and databases that we have permission to modify.

To setup the database that we will use, we first right click the database tab and select New Database. We then name the database and then click add. From there, we then need to give all of the user accounts that we made for the project access to that database. We go to the security tab and then into the logins tab. We then right click o one of the user accounts and go to properties. From there, we go to the bottom of the first page and change the default database from master to what we named out server. From there, we tehn go to user mapping and check the box next to our server. This will then give permission for the account to view and make edits to tables in that database and only that database unless we need to make a second one. From there, we repeat the process for all of the other accounts .
